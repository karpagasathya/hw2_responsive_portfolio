## Description
Mostly used Bootstrap to create this. Semantic HTML tags are used. 
Components in Bootstrap used are:
- Navbar
- grid system
- Card 
- Form 
- buttons

margin, padding and width are modified using Bootstrap and minified the use of CSS.
HTML files are validated using validation service.
